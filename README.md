#The Rolling Stones  

This site will represent the branding of the Rolling Stones with bold colours clearly showing their years of success through the years since 1962.

The overall feel of the site is uncluttered, fun with a pop of rock for all ages. 

 
## UX

The Rolling Stones Website is focusing on people of all ages accross the world. Below are 6 User Stories which represent users accross the world of all ages.

By using Personas for each User we get a far more in depth knowledge of each persons relationship with technology and requirements to enrich their lives, we can then create an environment which will envoke a feeling of happiness and excitement which would be the main objective of The Rolling Stones. 

I have chosen to create a seperate persona using Rosie's CV site provided through Code Institues learning material as the site layout is clean and clear which helps get a clearer picture, focusing on the user. This will create an easy environment for any member of a design team to revisit each user at any time to refocus actions and goals required to achieve optimum results. 
It may benefit to provide an area where members of the team can add notes and thoughts, this would give other members an opportunity to share ideas and discuss how users motivations and frustrations can be adequately addressed.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

I researched multiple sites on the best way to provide a responsive site for all devices using CSS. I have used the Grid System from The Net Ninja's tutorial on creating a 3 column grid which allows for multiple breakpoints to enhance the user experience on all devices. Throughout the construction of the site I would have regularly tested each view using Chrome Developer Tools to ensure breakpoints were intriducted at the most appropriate place ensuring the best view was achieved fro each environment without losing the main focus call to actions. 

When creating Newsletter SignUp page the first choice was a simple name ans email input screen with no popups but this looked quite ugly and distracting on the page, a simple signup button looks far more visably appealing and clears any distractions from the screen allowing the user to focus on completing their details simply and quickly.

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
